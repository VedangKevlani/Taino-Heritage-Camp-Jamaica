                    Unlike traditional history lessons, THC focuses on activity-based learning, where the past becomes a tool to inspire, 
                    nurture, and help students develop different skills. You’ll learn directly in a Taino Yukayeke (village), 
                    gaining a new perspective on culture and heritage.
                </p>

        With the river Eden and its tributaries surrounding the park on three sides we are blessed with a great palm grove, 
        lush botanical gardens, flower farms, and a natural 'clay spa' and bathing pool.

        The Taino Heritage Camp at Coki Yukayeke is a re-enactment of Pre-Colombian Taino living.  
        We are a registered independent school, creating grassroots programs and workshops in Jamaica for over 20 years.  
        Our workshops are fun, interactive, and fully immersive—built on a philosophy of learning through heritage and nature.
